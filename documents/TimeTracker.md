Day 1 : SRS document.Prepared the genral layout of the application, the requirements and all of the mockups I planned to develop on paper.
Day 2 : Developed on paper the required API for the backend of the application.Decided that the beer list and add a beer features
would be handled by a beer service and the user login would be taken care by the user service.Finalized the Schema for the beer card.
Time Spent : 2-3 hours in total for this work.(Started out a bit relaxed :) As with every assignment :P)

Day 3 : Environment setup.This took way longer than expected.Ran into some angular issues but managed to get around them.Since it was
the first time using that environment.Worked on the login page html css and the required components.

            b) Login Page Html/CSS/Components
            c) User API to handle the login event.

Day 4: As I started getting a bit more comfortable with angular, I started getting things much more quicker.So on this day I started
with the beer list service and completed it.Coded the Schema for the databse as well.Realised I needed an upvote and downvote button
as specified by Chrisitan. :)
Work done : a) Beer list Html/css/components
            b) Beer Model Schema completion
            b) Beer List api to handle the display of beers onto the beer list page.

(Realised I had two days left and quite a bit of work to be done :) Time to bring out the late night cofee.) 

Day 5: On day 5 I was a bit busy with some other work so I could not give a lot of time, but still got the beer addition page
